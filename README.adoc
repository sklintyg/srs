----
Will use application-local.properties to override values form application.properties

Starting in mode for receiving Integration test requests:
----
./gradlew clean bootRun -Denv=it -Dport=8081
----

Running integration tests:
----
./gradlew restAssuredTest -Dport=8081

== Notes on prediction model version 2.2 and forSubdiagnosis (search tags: forSubDiags _subdiag_group resolution)
In prediction model version 2.2 there were two variants of the prediction models, one for 3-character diagnosis codes (e.g. M79) and
one for sub diagnosises (e.g. M797) both model files were named with a three letter code for the diagnosis froup (e.g. M79).
The one for subdiagnosises contained extra questions ending with _subdiag_group that could be answered automatically depending on which of
the sub diagnosises we worked with.
In Prediction model 3.0 all of the diagnosises are represented for themselves istead, i.e. M797 has a corresponding PredictionDiagnosis
entity, its own model and set of questions.


== Runtime

To get the application up and running, you have to do three things in preparation:

=== Install R

R is used for prediction modelling, and the 'rJava' package is used as the bridge between Java and R.

Install a recent version of R, using your package manager of choice. R packages have been tried with Mac Homebrew, Arch Linux and CentOS.

If running OS X (possibly others), we need to prepare R with a JDK:
----
R CMD javareconf
----

Install 'rJava' and 'pch' into the R environment. This is most easily done by logging in to R (i.e. start 'R' from the command line) and then run the
lines:
----
install.packages("rJava")
install.packages("pch")
----

To exit the R command shell, type:

----
quit()
----

Now you need to figure out things: where your R environment has been installed, and where the rJava package has been installed.

==== OS X
On Mac OS using Homebrew, it's probably:
----
R_HOME=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
java.library.path=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rJava/jri
----
or on High Sierra it was:

----
R_HOME=/usr/local/lib/R
java.library.path=/usr/local/lib/R/3.4/site-library/rJava/jri
----

==== Arch Linux
On Arch Linux, it's probably:
----
R_HOME=/usr/lib64/R
java.library.path="$HOME/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/rJava/jri"
----

==== CentOS
On CentOS, it's probably:
----
R_HOME=/usr/lib64/R
java.library.path=/usr/lib64/R/library/rJava/jri
----

These values will be used when the srs application is started, but first:


=== R models

R models for testing purposes are checked-in into version control, and can be found at src/main/resources/model.


=== Building and running the application

Now that the dependencies are taken care of, we build the application as usual:

 ./gradlew clean build

To run the application run the following, substituting your values for R_HOME and java.library.path:

 R_HOME=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources java -Djava.library.path="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rJava/jri" -Dresources.folder="[SRS-project]/src/main/resources" -jar build/libs/*.war --spring.profiles.active=runtime,it

Replace [SRS-project] with your local SRS-project directory
The 'runtime' profile is necessary to make sure that a real connection to the R engine is created.
The 'it' profile is needed to enable the testability api (used in restAssured integration tests).

OS X example:
----
R_HOME=/usr/local/lib/R java -Djava.library.path="/usr/local/lib/R/3.5/site-library/rJava/jri" -Dresources.folder="/Users/eriklupander/intyg/SRS/src/main/resources" -jar build/libs/*.war --spring.profiles.active=runtime,it
----


Additional profiles:
'remote' - Uses the jndi configured jdbc-resource as datasource and uses log4j-config from srs-konfiguration.
'local' - Uses a local mysql database configured in application-local.properties

To debug the application use the following:

 -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005

=== SoapUI

There is a SoapUI in the project repository which can be used to fire test messages at the application once it's running. Import the file
soapui/GetSRSInformation-soapui-project.xml into your SoapUI and try it.

== Run with docker (with pre-installed java and R)
To run with docker, use the following commands:

1) host, from srs directory

----
./gradlew clean build
docker run -it -e TZ=Europe/Stockholm -p 8080:8080 -v <complete_path_to_srs_folder_in_host_os>:/srs --entrypoint=/bin/bash jaehyeon/r-java
----

Note that the timezone environment variable is required due to integrations tests that make an assumption that the timezone host and the container is the same. If timezone of the host is not Europe/Stockholm, change the timezone variable accordingly.


2) container

----
/usr/bin/R
install.packages("pch")
40
quit()
n
cd /srs
R_HOME=/usr/lib/R java -Djava.library.path="/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rJava/jri" -Dresources.folder="/srs/src/main/resources" -jar build/libs/*.war --spring.profiles.active=runtime,it
----

== H2

When running locally (without the mysql profile), a H2 database is used, and a console to the database servier is automatically started. It
is available at:

http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

Within the console, specify this address to connect to the database: 'jdbc:h2:mem:testdb'


== Ansible

The ansible provisioning is similar to all other intygsprojekt-services: the baseline provisioning is found in the 'tools' git repo. In the
srs repo, the ansible provision/deploy is in the file site.yml.

Here's an example of running the 'site.yml' for provisioning to test, using what you've built on your local machine:

 ansible-playbook -i inventory/srs/test site.yml -e "gitcrypt_key_file=/opt/key/git-crypt4.key gitcrypt_key_name=git-crypt4.key" -e "version=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT" -e "deploy_from_repo=false"


== ktlint

As of now, "ktlint" is one of few code quality tools that work with Kotlin code. To run ktlint on the SRS code, type "gradle ktlintCheck".
